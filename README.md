## Interactive Demo

[demo.html](demo.html) is a standalone webpage that displays an interactive knowledge graph. When you open it, it shows a large, explorable network of ideas or entities connected by relationships. You can zoom, pan, and click around to see how everything links together. All the data for the graph is already built into the file, so it works on its own with no setup. It’s basically a packaged, portable viewer for exploring a structured map of information.

demo.kge is a demo knowledge Graph with embeddiongs. A .kgc file can also be loaded and saved with embeddiongs(as a .kge) file. 

**Note:**

demo.html, demo.kge and demo.kgc can all be created using Neil Greisman's Knowledge_Graphs application.
